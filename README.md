# meetup-franceia
Project to get guest list who signed in a meetup we organize on meetup.com


## Todo list

1- do a web page where we can:
    - choose a meetup event from DefendIntelligence (date of the event, city): list from API
    - display all guests who signed in for this event (name & email at least) : from the API

2- get the infos from API : https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/meetup_api/docs/

3- we can implement a CSV export for the guest list
